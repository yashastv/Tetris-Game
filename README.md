# Tetris Game – HTML, CSS, JavaScript 🎮

A classic Tetris game fully built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a frontend project. This project showcases interactive gameplay, practical use of data structures and algorithms (DSA), and game logic implementation from scratch.

## ✨ Features
- **Classic Tetris gameplay**: Move, rotate, and stack tetrominoes to clear full rows.
- **Interactive UI**: Responsive controls for moving and rotating pieces.
- **Scoring system**: Tracks and displays score with line-clearing logic.
- **Collision detection**: Ensures all pieces remain within the boundaries and stack as expected.
- **Matrix rotation logic**: Efficiently rotates tetrominoes using 2D array transformation.
- **Game Over detection**: Ends the game and resets when new pieces can't spawn.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
2. git clone <https://github.com/yashas-tv/Tetris-Game>
cd tetris-game

Run the game:

Locate the index.html file in the project folder.

Double-click on index.html to open the game in your default web browser.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Canvas API (for rendering)

## 📚 Concepts Used
- 2D arrays for grid and tetromino modeling.
- Collision detection algorithms.
- Matrix rotation for piece rotation (90-degree transpose and reverse).
- DOM manipulation and event handling.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Applied data structures and algorithms in a real project.
- Developed an interactive browser-based game without libraries.
- Connected DSA concepts (matrix rotation, collision checking) with frontend logic.
